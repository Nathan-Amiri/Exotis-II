Exotis II is a PvP action platformer, in which players can mix and match abilities to create custom characters before each match

Created in Unity and coded in C#

Exotis II was created using an old networking solution, and was not fully compatible with Unity's servers.
Work on migrating the game to a newer networking solution has begun, and the game is currently not in a playable state.
